Def:-The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE condition/clause, to serarch a specific condition in a column.
There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
   The percent sign % represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
   The underscore sign _ represents one, single character.
Syntax:-
SELECT column1, column2,..
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Ex:-
SELECT * 
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%';

1)The _ Wildcard:-
The _ wildcard represents a single character.
It can be any character or number, but each _ represents one, and only one, character.
Ex:- Return all customers from a city that starts with 'L' followed by one wildcard character, then 'nd' and then two wildcard characters.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city LIKE 'L_nd__';

2)The % Wildcard:-
The % wildcard represents any number of characters, even zero characters.
Ex:-Return all customers from a city that contains the letter 'L':
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city LIKE '%L%';

*Starts With:-
To return records that starts with a specific letter or phrase, add the % at the end of the letter or phrase.
Ex:- SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'La%';

EX:- You can also combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'b%';

Ex:-Ends With
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a';

Ex:-Start and End.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE "a%b";

Ex:-Contains(Return all customers that contains the phrase 'or')
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';

Ex:-Combine Wildcards
Any wildcard, like % and _ , can be used in combination with other wildcards.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';

Ex:-Return all customers that have "r" in the second position:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';

Ex:-Without Wildcard
If no wildcard is specified, the phrase has to have an exact match to return a result.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country LIKE 'Spain';
