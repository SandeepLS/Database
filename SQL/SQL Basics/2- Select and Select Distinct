1)SELECT:-
The SELECT statement is used to, select data from a database.
Syntax:- SELECT column1, column2,...
         FROM table_name;
         
ex:- SELECT CustomerName,City FROM Customers;
Select all columns:- SELECT * FROM Customers;


2)SELECT DISTINCT:-
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.(it remove duplicate values)
Syntax:-SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;

Ex:-SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.
