IN:- it allows us to specify multiple values in a WHERE condition.
      Ex:Return all customers from 'Germany', 'France', or 'UK'
      SELECT *
      FROM Customers
      WHERE Country IN ('Germany','France','UK');

NOT IN:-Using NOT Keyword, in front of IN Operator,-
        we get all records, that are not any of the values, Present in the list.
        Ex:Return all customers that are NOT from 'Germany', 'France', or 'UK':
        SELECT * 
        FROM Customers
        WHERE Country NOT IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');

IN (SELECT):-
You can also use IN with a subquery in the WHERE clause.
Ex:Return all customers that have an order in the Orders table:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);

NOT IN (SELECT):-
The result in the example above returned 74 records, that means that there are 17 customers that haven't placed any orders.
Let us check if that is correct, by using the NOT IN operator.

Example:Return all customers that have NOT placed any orders in the Orders table:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);
