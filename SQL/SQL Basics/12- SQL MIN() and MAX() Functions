  The MIN() function, returns the smallest value of the selected column.
  The MAX() function, returns the largest value of the selected column.
  
  Syntax:-Min()/Max()
  SELECT Min(coloumn_name)/Max(column_name)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  
  Ex:- Find the lowest Price
  SELECT Min(Price)
  From Products;
  
  Ex:- Find the largest price
  SELECT Max(price)
  FROM Products;

2)Set Column Name (Alias)
  When you use MIN() or MAX(), the returned column will be named MIN(field) or MAX(field) by default. To give the column a new name, use the AS keyword:
  Example:-
  SELECT MIN(Price) AS SmallestPrice
  FROM Products;

  O/P:-
  SmallestPrice
  2.5
