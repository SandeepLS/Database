Def:-self join is a regular join, but the table join with itself.
Syntax:
SELECT column_name
FROM table1, table2
WHERE condition;

Ex:
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
