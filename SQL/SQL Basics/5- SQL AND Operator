1) AND Operator:- The WHERE clause can contain one or many AND operators.
The AND operator is used to, filter records based on more than one condition.

Syntax:-
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

Ex:- 
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%';

AND vs OR
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions are TRUE.
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions are TRUE.

2)Combining AND and OR:-
Example:- Select all Spanish customers that starts with either "G" or "R":-
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND (CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');

Example:- Select all customers that either:
are from Spain and starts with either "G", or
starts with the letter "R":-
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%';
