  Syntax:-
  SELECT SUM(column_name)
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;

  SELECT SUM(Quantity)
  FROM OrderDetails;
  
  Ex:-Add a Where Clause:-
  Return the number of orders made for the product with ProductID 11:
  SELECT SUM(Quantity)

  FROM OrderDetails;
  
  Ex:-SUM() With an Expression
  SELECT SUM(Quantity * 10)
  FROM OrderDetails;
  
  Ex:-We can also join the OrderDetails table to the Products table to find the actual amount, instead of assuming it is 10 dollars:
  Join OrderDetails with Products, and use SUM() to find the total amount:
  SELECT SUM(Price * Quantity)
  FROM OrderDetails
  LEFT JOIN Products
  ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID;
