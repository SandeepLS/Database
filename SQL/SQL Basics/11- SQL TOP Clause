1)SQL SELECT TOP Clause:-
  The SELECT TOP clause is used to, specify the number of records to return.
  The SELECT TOP clause is useful, on large tables with thousands of records.
  
  Example:- Select only the first 3 records of the Customers table:
  SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;
  
  Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. 
  MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records, 
  while Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.

  Syntax:-SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:
          SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
          FROM table_name
          WHERE condition;
  Ex:-SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;

2)SQL TOP PERCENT Example:-
  The following SQL statement selects the first 50% of the records from the "Customers" table (for SQL Server/MS Access):
  Example:-
  SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

3)ADD a WHERE CLAUSE:-
  The following SQL statement selects the first three records from the "Customers" table, where the country is "Germany".
  Ex:-
  SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers
  WHERE Country ="German";
