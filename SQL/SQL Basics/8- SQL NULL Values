Def:-A field with a NULL value, is a field with no value.
Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value.

How to Test for NULL Values?
It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.
We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

1)IS NULL:- The IS NULL operator, is used to test for empty values (NULL values).
Syntax:-
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

Ex:-
SELECT CustomerName, Price
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName IS NULL;

Tip: Always use IS NULL to look for NULL values.

2)IS NOT NULL:- The IS NOT NULL operator, is used to test for non-empty values(NOT NULL values).
Syntac:-
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

Ex:-
SELECT CustomerName, Price
FROM Customers
WHERE Price IS NOT NULL;
