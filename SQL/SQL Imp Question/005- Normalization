What is normalization in SQL? 
Normalization is technique of organizing data in a database, to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.
It is multi-step process, that puts data nto tabuler form. Removing the duplicate data from its relational tabel.

Normalization is used mainly two purpose:-
-It is used to eliminate repeated data.
-to ensure the data dependencies, make some logical sense.

Anomalies:- if tabel is not properly normalized.
-Insertion, Update & Deletion anomaly.

Types:-
(A)1st Normal form:-
Removes repeting groups from the tabel.
Create a seperate tabel, for each set of Related data.
Identify each set of Related data, with a Primary key.
It state that, the domain of attributes, Must include atomic values(Simple, Indivisible).

(B)2nd Normal form:-
Tabel should not have Partial Dependency-
Means, the non-prime attribute, is functionally dependent, on part of Composit key.

(C)3rd Normal form:-
There should be no Transitive dependency.-
Means, Non-prime attribute must be dependent on, other non-prime attributes.
Ex:-StudentName, StudentID, SubjectID, Subject, Address:-
StudentID, is dependent on StudentName, SubID & Address.But
SubjectID is only dependent on SubjectName.

(D)BCN:-Boyce Code Normal Form
Every functional dependency A->B, then A has to be the Super key, of that particular tabel.
Super key: is a group of, singel or multiple keys, Which identifies rows in a tabel.
