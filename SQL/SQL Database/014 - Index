Index:- 
The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.

Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly.
The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.

Syntax:-
Creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed:
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);

Syntax:-
Creates a unique index on a table. Duplicate values are not allowed:
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);

Example:-
CREATE INDEX idx_pname
ON Persons (LastName, FirstName);

DROP INDEX Statement:-
The DROP INDEX statement is used to delete an index in a table.
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP INDEX index_name;
